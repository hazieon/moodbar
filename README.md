# Hackathon Week 7
Find a drink recipe to fit your mood!
A challenge as part of the School of Code bootcamp to use an API, practice group idea ideation and agile workflow to build an MVP of a web application.
As a 4, we ideated and decided to build an app to generate a drink recipe based on your mood. For ideating, we used the disney ideation flow of 'dreamer, critic, realist' stages.
We used a cocktail drinks API and used React to build components. 
After the project, I touched up the functionality to bring in non-alcoholic mocktail options. I also updated the CSS to resemble a neon bar.

Lockdown drinks, anyone?
